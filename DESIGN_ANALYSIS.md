## Analysis Summary - All 3 Templates:

2. **Cyber.AI** - Pure black bg, neon glow, statistics with big numbers, purple/blue accents
3. **Cybersecurity** - Professional trust elements, clean layout (but too corporate for us)

### Final Direction for PIKALEADS:

- Dark background with purple gradients (Cyber.AI)
- Orange/Yellow accents like Brache (but use Pikachu yellow #FFD93D)
- Cyberpunk character style (Pikachu as mascot)
- Neon glow effects (Cyber.AI)
- 3D mockups showing services (Brache)
- Big statistics numbers (Cyber.AI)
- "STEP INTO THE ELECTRIC DIMENSION" concept (adapted from Brache)
- Fun + Professional balance (not too corporate)

### Avoid:
- Too corporate/serious look (Cybersecurity template)
- Generic centered layouts
- Boring color schemes
